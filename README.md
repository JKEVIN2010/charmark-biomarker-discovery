Imagine a future where your casual conversation—describing a picture, chatting with a friend—could reveal the earliest whispers of cognitive change.  
**CharMark** brings that future a step closer. It’s a lightweight Python toolkit that turns plain text transcripts into interpretable “fingerprints” of your speech, helping researchers and clinicians spot subtle signs of dementia before they become unmissable.

## Why CharMark?

Traditional speech analyses dive into audio waves or complex neural nets—powerful, but often opaque. CharMark asks a different question:  
> **“At the level of single characters and pauses, how does language flow?”**

By building a first-order Markov chain from your transcript, then computing its steady-state probabilities, CharMark captures micro-patterns—like hesitation in pauses or recurring letter sequences—that can serve as early digital biomarkers of cognitive decline.

## Key Features

- **Clean & Simple**: Load your CSV of transcripts, call a few methods, and get back matrices of interpretable features.  
- **Interpretable**: Character-level probabilities, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, PCA plots, and network visualizations lay bare why two groups differ.  
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: From raw text cleaning to unsupervised clustering and Lasso-based validation, everything’s in one place.  
- **Lightweight**: No massive datasets or GPUs required—just Python and your transcripts.
